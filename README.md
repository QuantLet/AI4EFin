AI4EFin is a research project developed under and financed by Romaniaâ€™s National Recovery and Resilience PlanPillar III. Smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, 
including economic cohesion, jobs, productivity, competitiveness, research, development, and innovation, and a well-functioning internal market with strong small 
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), Component C9/I8.

AI4EFin involves design-oriented research to develop a set of new ML/AI methods for energy finance. Each design goal is accompanied by large-scale empirical experimentation 
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new instruments vis-a-vis established benchmarks in relevant energy finance use cases related to decision analysis and risk management.

Objectives:
- Objective 1: To provide new ML/AI models for finance and energy market time series
- Objective 2: To build XAI methodology for explaining deep learning-based time series forecasts
- Objective 3: To devise probabilistic ML/AI models for energy finance risk management
- Objective 4: To develop methodology for causal discovery and effect estimation in energy finance
- Objective 5: To create and disseminate knowledge
